      Light weight object relational mapper (ORM) for MS SQL 
    </summary>
    <description>
      CoPilot is an object relational mapper (ORM) with a specific purpose. If you are looking for a full featured enterprise level ORM then CoPilot is probably not what you are looking for. CoPilot is designed to simplify the implementation of the database access layer. You will be the "pilot", while CoPilot will handle most of the tedious routine work.

      CoPilot is more like a micro ORM, but with some neat features added on top.

      Note: This is still an early version and only works with MSSQL - use at your own risk!
